# Changelog 

**Repository:** `ospo-resources`  
**Description:** `Tracks all notable changes, version history, and roadmap toward 1.0.0 following Semantic Versioning.`  
**SPDX-License-Identifier:** `OGL-UK-3.0`  

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file. 
This project follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** ([semver.org](https://semver.org/)), using the format: 


`[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]` 
- **MAJOR** (`X.0.0`) – Incompatible API/feature changes that break backward compatibility. 
- **MINOR** (`0.X.0`) – Backward-compatible new features, enhancements, or functionality changes. 
- **PATCH** (`0.0.X`) – Backward-compatible bug fixes, security updates, or minor corrections. 
- **Pre-release versions** – Use suffixes such as `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc.1` (e.g., `2.1.0-beta.1`). 
- **Build metadata** – If needed, use `+build` (e.g., `2.1.0+20250314`).

## Future Roadmap to `1.0.0` 

The `0.90.x` series is part of NDTP’s **pre-stable development cycle**, meaning: 
- **Minor versions (`0.91.0`, `0.92.0`...) introduce features and improvements** leading to a stable `1.0.0`. 
- **Patch versions (`0.90.1`, `0.90.2`...) contain only bug fixes and security updates**. 
- **Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed until `1.0.0`**, though NDTP aims to minimise breaking changes. 

Once `1.0.0` is reached, future versions will follow **strict SemVer rules**.

## Versioning Policy 

1. **MAJOR updates (`X.0.0`)** – Typically introduce breaking changes that require users to modify their code or configurations. 
- **Breaking changes (default rule)**: Any backward-incompatible modifications require a major version bump. 
- **Non-breaking major updates (exceptional cases)**: A major version may also be incremented if the update represents a significant milestone, such as a shift in governance, a long-term stability commitment, or substantial new functionality that redefines the project’s scope. 
2. **MINOR updates (`0.X.0`)** – New functionality that is backward-compatible. 
3. **PATCH updates (`0.0.X`)** – Bug fixes, performance improvements, or security patches. 
4. **Dependency updates** – A **major dependency upgrade** that introduces breaking changes should trigger a **MAJOR** version bump (once at `1.0.0`).

## How to Update This Changelog 

1. When making changes, update this file under the **Unreleased** section. 
2. Before a new release, move changes from **Unreleased** to a new dated section with a version number. 
3. Follow **Semantic Versioning** rules to categorise changes correctly. 
4. If pre-release versions are used, clearly mark them as `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc.X`.
