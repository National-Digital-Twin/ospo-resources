# This file contains relative paths to workflows required specifically for forked repositories.
# These workflows are synchronised only if the target repository is a fork AND has the 
# repository variable `FORK_WORKFLOWS_OPT_IN` set to 'true'.
# If a workflow file listed here is not found in the target repository, it will be
# automatically synchronised and committed to the source branch of the pull request.
